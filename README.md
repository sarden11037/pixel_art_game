# pixel_art_game
Pixel art game is a simple webapp utility that creates a grid based on rows and columns. The user can select the size of the grid and the grid will populate on the screen. Once the grid appears users can click inside grid cells to fill them with any color that is selected with the color selector. 
This project uses a series of open-source web utilities to make this app possible. Some technologies used to make this application possible are `jQuery` `bootstrap` `javscript` `html` and `css`.
